# Haishin's Transcriber

This is the package responsible for starting the stream archiver, handling all the video splitting, sending to OpenAI's whisper and then sending transcriptions to DeepL for translations.

You could _probably_ use this if you do something similar to what I've done here. If demand maybe I can see about publishing it to npm?
