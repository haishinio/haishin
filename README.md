## TODOs

#### Future
- Can we not use the best preset so we can save on filesize
- Deployment?
- Can we move whisper offline? (ie rather than call openai and the live whisper, we download the model ourselves? whisper-cpp?)
- Can we pull in comments + gifts from livestreams?
- Can we add auth so you could comment directly from here?
